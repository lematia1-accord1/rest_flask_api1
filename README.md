Build a web application that manages the following user information:
-id(this should be auto-incrementing integer primary key in the database)
-first name
-last name
-date of birth
-nationality
The data should be stored in a relation database.
Create a REST API around this application with the following endpoints:
-create a new user
-fetch all users information in the system 
-update an existing user
-delete an existing user
-get the age of the user
Feel free to design the API as you see fit, the final application should be commited to a public repository,
preferably github.
